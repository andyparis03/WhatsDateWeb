  "Create a vibrant horizontal thin banner with a modern gradient background transitioning from WhatsApp
  green (#25D366) on the left to mid grey on the right, with subtle hints of electric blue and
   orange. The banner should feature playful, minimalist icons floating across the design: chat bubbles with smartphone notifications, small WhatsApp-style message indicators, AI brain symbols, and connection lines between profile avatars. Include subtle geometric patterns like dots and flowing
  lines in the background. The icons should be semi-transparent (60% opacity) in white and complementary colors, IMPORTANT : ONLY 2  ICONS > bright fuchsia pink (#FF1493),
  scattered organically across the banner with some overlapping for depth. Add a very subtle bokeh effect and soft
  glow to give it a modern, tech-savvy feel. The overall style should be contemporary, fun, and energetic while
  maintaining professional elegance - perfect for app that integrates with WhatsApp. Ensure the design
  is clean enough to not distract from text overlay but colorful enough to add visual interest and break the
  monotony of the dark theme."
